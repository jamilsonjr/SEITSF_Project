(Good explanation on hybrid here <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_xCssR8qQI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_xCssR8qQI</a>) The electric mode has the same efficiency as the pure electric powertrain, So the efficiency of this power train can be:</p><div><ul><li>In electrical mode, the <img src="main_eq10232353274757744545.png" alt="$\eta_{overall}=\eta_{overall-electric}$" style="width:141px;height:10px;">;</li><li>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_generator">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_generator</a>, it is reasonable to assume that the performance of the diesel generator is 65%;</li></ul></div><p>Thus the overall performance is given by:</p><div><ul><li><img src="main_eq08050625478612174252.png" alt="$\eta_{overall} = \eta_{overall-electric}$" style="width:141px;height:10px;">, when <img src="main_eq11094816885922138075.png" alt="$v<50 km/h$" style="width:79px;height:15px;"></li><li><img src="main_eq10516105560205269184.png" alt="$\eta_{overall} = \eta_{overall-electric}\eta_{diesel-generator}$" style="width:227px;height:11px;">, when <img src="main_eq05879762143486182419.png" alt="$v&gt;50 km/h$" style="width:79px;height:15px;"></li></ul></div><pre class="codeinput">efficiency_diesel_generator = 0.65;

Finally the speed reaches 40 km/h the parallel hybrid work on pure combustion engine, presenting the same power consumption as a pure combustion car. The series hybrid powertrain performs allways in between the pure electric and the pure combustion car.

Given the fact that the great majority of the population drives pure combustion cars, it is interesting to note the time that would take for the extra money paid for the other powertrains to be worth it: The cost of the pure combustion car is 20k euros.</p><div><ul><li>The cost of the parallel hybrid is 25k, so, according to this simulation, the parallel hybrid spends minus 40 euros per year in fuel, so it would take 125 years for for it to be worth it. However, if the costumer has the majority of his driving time in a urban area (a Uber driver for instants), it will spend less money due to the better perfomance in this regime;</li><li>The cost of the series hybrid is 30k, so, according to the same analysis, it would take 37 years for the saved money saved be equal to the value of the car, but once again, if the solo urban driving is practiced, the extra money would be paid off quicker;</li><li>Finally, the pure electric powertrain costs 35k, and according to the same analysis, it would take 25 years for the money saved to be paid off, but once again, and even more so now, if a more urban driving profile is taken into practice, it would take less time to pay of the investment;</li></ul></div><h2 id="133">Discussing Solutions</h2><p>Verifying the assumptions made, the pure electric powertrain is the most efficient out of the 4 overall. And in last place comes the combustion one with the lowest efficiency, which creates some doubts on it&#8217;s powerful position in the vehicle industry, with a smashing presence around the world. Looking at the economic conclusions taken, the reason why combustion motor cars are prevalent on the market is basically the overall price, with the other 3 options coming a bit behind moneywise. It would be interesting to maybe consider the Series/Parallel approach which has some good efficiency results but we didn&#8217;t get to study. Although the combustion powertrain is the cheapest one we should consider certain important aspects about the newer electric solution. The most prominent problem with electric cars is the buying price, with the battery price continuing to be really high and, in some cases, needing to be replaced after an accident. But this issue may change soon, with the development of electric cars technology as well as the virtuous cycle of ever-lower prices that leads to increasing demand and therefore the economies of scale manufacturers need to produce ever-cheaper batteries and cars. Second important aspect is climate friendly aspect which the combustion car lacks. This being an serious care for most countries around the world it is understandable the government efforts to help grow this market, which once again helps buying power of customers in an initial phase. In the middle we got the series and parallel powertrains that have lower gas emissions than the combustion but still are a problem for the environment.</p><pre class="codeinput">close <span class="string">all</span>

%% Vehicles Configurations and assumptions
% In the study there are 4 possible powertrain configurations of  light duty urban vehicles, presented in
% the figures (1), (2), (3) and (4). They consist of pure electric, pure
% combustion, series hybrid and paralel hybrid.
%
%% Assumptions: Pure Electric Powertrain
% 
% In this configuration the battery is in series with the electric
% motor/generator in series with the transmission.
% There are two possible modes of functioning, the motor discharging the
% velocities while accelerating, and the opposite, generator charging the velocities decelerating.
%% 
% *Acceleration:*
% During discharge the ciruit has an efficiency different from 100%. The overalll
% efficiecy $\eta_{overall}$ is given by the product of the individual effinciency of
% each component of the circuit.
%%
% $\eta_{overall}=\prod_{i=1}\eta_i$. 
%%
% Thus, for this powertrain, one has that [ $battery \rightarrow motor
% \rightarrow transmission$ ] will translate in a overall efficiency given
% by: 
%%
% $\eta_{overall}=\eta_{battery}\eta_{motor}\eta_{transmission}$
%% 
% * Assuming that the velocities are made from lithium-ion, according to
% <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery> it is reasonable to assume that
% the discharging effinciency of the battery of around 80%;
% * From <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car#Energy_efficiency> it
% is reasonable to assume that the electric motor has an efficiency of 70%;
% * From <https://www.nap.edu/read/21744/chapter/7> it is resonable to
% assume that the efficiency of an automatic transmission is 90%;
% So the the overall discharging performance can be computed:
%%
efficiency_battery_discharge = 0.8;
efficiency_transmission = 0.9;
efficiency_motor = 0.8;
efficiency_pure_electric_discharging = efficiency_battery_discharge*efficiency_motor*efficiency_transmission;

%% 
% Thus the electric power in acceleration is given by:
%% 
% $P_{electric}= {P_{mecanic} \over \eta_{overall}}$
%%
% *Deceleration*
% During deceleration, it is assumed that the motor works as a generator,
% recharging the battery. Although it is the same path as acceleration [ $transmission
% \rightarrow generator \rightarrow battery$ ], the efficiencies have
% different values.
%%
% * From it is reasonable to assume that the discharging effinciency of the battery of around 90%;
% * Its is reasonable to assume that the generator has an efficiency of
% 80%;
% * Similarly to the accelaration, it is reasonable to assume that the
% transmission has an efficiency of 90%;
% So the the overall charging performance can be computed:
%%
efficiency_battery_charge = 0.9;
efficiency_transmission = 0.9;
efficiency_generator = 0.7;
efficiency_pure_electric_charging = efficiency_battery_charge*efficiency_generator*efficiency_transmission;
%% 
% Thus the electric power in deceleration is given by:
%% 
% $P_{electric}= P_{mecanic}\eta_{overall}$

%% Assumptions: Series Hybrid Powertrain
%
% In the configuration, there is a series connection between the fuel, the
% diesel generator, the battery pack, the motor/generator, and the
% transmission.
% Knowing that combustion engines only have a good performace in a narrow
% rpm band, called power band, it is assumed that, similiar do hybrid
% cars in the market, the car can operate in pure electric mode for a velocities
% under 50 km/h and as a hybrid for highier velocities. (Good explanation on hybrid here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_xCssR8qQI>)
% The electric mode has the same efficiency as the pure electric powertrain,
% So the efficiency of this power train can be:
%%
% 
% * In electrical mode, the $\eta_{overall}=\eta_{overall-electric}$;
% * According to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_generator>, it is
% reasonable to assume that the performance of the diesel generator is 65%;
% 
%%
% Thus the overall performance is given by:
%%
% * $\eta_{overall} = \eta_{overall-electric}$, when $v<50 km/h$
% * $\eta_{overall} = \eta_{overall-electric}\eta_{diesel-generator}$, when $v>50 km/h$
%%
efficiency_diesel_generator = 0.65;
efficiency_hybrid_series_electric_charging = efficiency_pure_electric_charging;
efficiency_hybrid_series_discharging = efficiency_pure_electric_discharging*efficiency_diesel_generator;

%% Assumptions: Parallel Hybrid Powertrain
% The parallel power train, there are two paths from the power source to the
% wheels:
%%
% 
% * The series between the fuel, the engine and the transmisson;
% * The series between the battery, the motor/generator and the
% transmission;
% 
%%
% It is no notice that the engine can act on the generator in order to
% charge the battery if needed.
% So, with this set up, we can consider that for velocities up to 20
% km/h, the powertrain functions in pure electric mode, for velocities
% greater than 40 km/h it works on pure combustion engine, for velocities 
% in between 20 and 40 km/h it demands half the power from the bateries and
% half from combustion. For breaking it is assumed that regenerative breaking
% allways works.
% With this, the efficiencies considered are:
%%
% 
% * According to <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine_efficiency>, it is
% considered that the motor is running on diesel engine, being of 30%. 
% * The electric path has the same efficiency as the pure electric
% powertrain.
%%
efficiency_hybrid_parallel_electric_charging = efficiency_pure_electric_charging;
efficiency_hybrid_parallel_electric_discharging = efficiency_pure_electric_discharging;
efficiency_hybrid_parallel_combustion_discharging = 0.30;
%% Assumptions: Pure Combustion Powertrain
% 
% This powertrain is fairly straight forward, being it's efficiency just
% the efficiency of the diesel motor.
%%
efficiency_pure_combustion_discharging = 0.30;
%% Power Consumption
%% Power Consumption: Theoretical Approach
% In this section it is of interest to compare the power consumption between
% the different powertrains.
% 
% The objective os to calculate:
%% 
% $P_T = F_Tv$ 
%%
% So, first, one must consider the traction force $F_T$ on each car. The
% forces present are:
%%
% * Motor force;
% * Drag force;
% * Friction force;
%% 
% $$ F_T = f_m m a + F_{drag} + F_{friction}$$
%%
% Being:
%%
% * $F_{drag} = {1 \over 2} \rho C_d A (v-(-v_w))^2)$
% * $F_{friction} = C_{rr} m g$ 
%% 
% $f_m \rightarrow mass factor$; $\rho\rightarrow$ densidade do meio; 
% $C_d\rightarrow$ aerodynamic drag coefficient; A $\rightarrow$ frontal 
% surface area; $v_w\rightarrow$ wind speed; $C_{rr}\rightarrow$ rolling  
% resistance coefficient; $m$ and $g$ mass a gravity;
%%
% Considering $f_m = 1.05$, $\rho = 1.225 kg/m^3$, $v_w = 25 km/h$ and using the constant values from the table(I) of the
% laboratory script, one can compute the values of $F_T$.
%%
air_density = 1.225;
mass_factor = 1.05;
drag_coefficient = 0.25;
surface_area = 2.7;
wind_speed = (25/3.6);
rolling_resistance_coefficient = 0.018;
mass = 1400;
gravity = 9.8;
%% Power Consumption: Computations Function
% *Function used to calculate the evolution of the powers in the driving
% cycles:*
%%
%   function [power] = AuxPowerCalculator(mechanical_power, velocity, power, efficiency_breaking, efficiency_mode_1, efficiency_mode_2)
%       for i=1:length(mechanical_power)
%           % When the system is breaking
%             if(mechanical_power(i) < 0)
%                 power(i) = mechanical_power(i) * efficiency_breaking;
%                 continue
%            end
%             % When the system's velocity is under 20km/h and not breaking
%             if(velocity(i)*3.6 < 20)
%                 power(i) = mechanical_power(i) / efficiency_mode_1;
%             end
%          % When system is between 20 and 40 km/h
%             if(velocity(i)*3.6 >= 20 && velocity(i)*3.6 <= 40)
%                 power(i) = (mechanical_power(i)/2) / (efficiency_mode_2) + (mechanical_power(i)/2) / (efficiency_mode_1);
%             end
%             if(velocity(i)*3.6 > 40)
%               power(i) = mechanical_power(i) / efficiency_mode_2;
%             end
%     end
% end
%% Power Consumption: Show Results Function
% In order to more easily show the results of each system, the mechanical
% power and the system output power are ploted at the same time, in order
% to better see the effect of the different efficiencies:
% For that, the following function was created
%% 
%   function [] = AuxShowPowerResults(time, power, mechanical_power, power_train)
%     figure()
%     plot(time, power/1000, time, mechanical_power/1000, 'LineWidth', 1);

%     legend( sprintf('%s Output Power', power_train), 'Mechanical Power');
%     grid on;
%   end
%% Power Consumption: Basic Driving Cycle
% Given the theoretical and functional approach taken above, the power 
% consumption can be computed.
% First the acceleration vector is necessary in order to compute the
% force.
%%
% The basic velocity must be converted from $km/h$ to $m/s$:
basic_velocity = basic_velocity/3.6;
time_step = basic_time(4) - basic_time(3);
basic_acceleration = diff(basic_velocity)/time_step;
% It is necessary to pop the last value of the time and velocity arrays due
% to the previous derivative:
basic_time(end) = [];
basic_velocity(end) = [];

force_drag = 0.5 * air_density * drag_coefficient * surface_area * (basic_velocity + wind_speed).^2;
force_friction = rolling_resistance_coefficient * mass * gravity;

% It is to notice that the negative values of power correspond to power

%% Power Consumption: Pure electric in Basic Driving Cycle
% Now, in order to calculate the power consumption carried by the pure
% electric power train. It will work in the follwing manner:
%%
% 
% * When the car is accelerating, the efficiency of discharged is applied
% in the power calculation;
% * When the car is decelerating, the efficiency of the charge is applied
% in the power calculation;
% 
%% 
% Thus, for the pure electric powertrain the power is given  by:
%%
pure_electric_power_basic_cycle = zeros(1, length(mechanical_power_basic_cycle));
pure_electric_power_basic_cycle = AuxPowerCalculator(mechanical_power_basic_cycle, basic_velocity, pure_electric_power_basic_cycle, efficiency_pure_electric_charging, efficiency_pure_electric_discharging, efficiency_pure_electric_discharging);

%% 
% As one can see on the figure above, as expected the electrical power
% consuption is greater than the mechanical power consumption, and I
% doesn't regenerate all the power available in the regenerative-breaking

%% Power Consumption: Parallel Hybrid in Basic Driving Cycle

%%
% 
% * When the velocity is less than $20km/h$, the car will run on electric
% power only;
% * When the car reaches the $20km/h$ mark, it will demand half the energy
% from the bateries and half the energy from the combustion engine;

%% Energy Recovery 
% The powertrains that have an electric motor/generator, can harnest the
% power of the breaking to restore the energy in the velocities. In this
% section, the quantity of this saved energy will be studied for each
% powertrains in each driving cycle.
%% Energy Recovery: Theorethical approach
% The energy recovered will correspond to the negative part of the graphics
% of the powerconsumption calculated above. It is to notice that the efficiency
% of charging is not the same as discharging, due to, bettwen other factors 
% related to the components, losses by heat.
% As it is expected, the pure combustion powertrain does not have negative 
% power consumption, because it does not have the components to restore energy.
% So in order to compute the total recovered energy, one must simply
% integrate the negative part of the power consumption graphs.

% For this driving cycle, pure electric powertrain perfomed better, with ~9.5% of
% energy recovery, followed by the series hybrid which recovered ~6.2%, followed
% by the parallel hybrid which recovered ~6.3% and last the pure combustion
% which can't recover any energy. 
% Even though the hybrids and the electric recover energy the same way, the reason that

% spend different amounts.

% As expected, the powertrains that spend less energy have a greater
% percentage of the energy recovered. The pure electric vehicle recovers
% ~5.4%, followed by the series hybrid which recovers ~3.5%, followed by the
% parallel hybrid that recovers ~3.0% of the energy.
% Thus, it is noticible that for the extra-urban cycle, the energy recovery
% does not have such great results as the urban cycle.
% It is also to notice that in a real life cenario, not all breakings
% correspond to a regenerative break, because if it is needed to break
% faster, mechanical breaking is necessary.
%% Economic Comparison
% Here it is usefull to compare the economical viability of each
% powertrain. The costs are compared in a spam of one year, in which the
% avarage car runs about 15000 km.
%% 
% To calculate what is the distance covered by the car in the mix driving
% cycle, one must only integrate the velocity:
%% 
distance_mix_cycle = trapz(mix_time, mix_velocity);
display(distance_mix_cycle/1000);
%%
% So, the number of *complete* mix driving cycles per year is given by:
%%
number_of_mix_cycles_per_year = 15000/(distance_mix_cycle/1000);
number_of_mix_cycles_per_year = floor(number_of_mix_cycles_per_year);
display(number_of_mix_cycles_per_year);
%%
% Having access to the power consumption for each powertrain, one can
% compute the cost in fuel per year:
%
% The yearly cost of the pure electric powertrain is given by:
%%
total_cost_electric = AuxFuelCalculator(mix_time, mix_velocity, pure_electric_power_mix_cycle, number_of_mix_cycles_per_year, 'Pure Electric');
display(total_cost_electric);
%%
% The yearly cost of the hybrid-series powertrain is given by:
%%
total_cost_series_hybrid = AuxFuelCalculator(mix_time, mix_velocity, series_hybrid_electric_power_mix_cycle, number_of_mix_cycles_per_year, 'Series Hybrid');
display(total_cost_series_hybrid);
%%
% The yearly cost of the pure combustion powertrain is given by:
%%
total_parallel_hybrid = AuxFuelCalculator(mix_time, mix_velocity, parallel_hybrid_electric_power_mix_cycle, number_of_mix_cycles_per_year, 'Parallel Hybrid');
display(total_parallel_hybrid);

%%
% The yearly cost of the pure combustion powertrain is given by:
%%
total_cost_combustion = AuxFuelCalculator(mix_time, mix_velocity, pure_combustion_power_mix_cycle, number_of_mix_cycles_per_year, 'Pure Combustion');
display(total_cost_combustion);
%% Economic comparison: Conclusions
% Thus, the conclusions are that the cost of fuel/charge for a year follow
% the powerconsumptions of the powertrains, having the pure combustion
% powertrain spending approximely twice as much as the pure electric, and
% the parallel hybrid spending more than the series hybrid.
% Given the fact that the great majority of the population drives pure
% combustion cars, it is interesting to note the time that would take for
% the extra money paid for the other powertrains to be worth it:
% The cost of the pure combustion car is 20k euros.
%%
% 
% * The cost of the parallel hybrid is 25k, so, according to this
% simulation, the parallel hybrid spends minus 40 euros per year in fuel,
% so it would take 125 years for for it to be worth it. However, if the
% costumer has the majority of his driving time in a urban area (a Uber driver for instants),
% it will spend less money due to the better perfomance in this regime;
% * The cost of the series hybrid is 30k, so, according to the same
% analysis, it would take 37 years for the saved money saved be equal to
% the value of the car, but once again, if the solo urban driving is
% practiced, the extra money would be paid off quicker;
% * Finally, the pure electric powertrain costs 35k, and according to the
% same analysis, it would take 25 years for the money saved to be paid off,
% but once again, and even more so now, if a more urban driving profile is
% taken into practice, it would take less time to pay of the investment;

%% Discussing Solutions
% Verifying the assumptions made, the pure electric powertrain is the most efficient out of the 4 overall. And in last place comes the combustion one with the lowest efficiency, which creates some doubts on it’s powerful position in the vehicle industry, with a smashing presence around the world.
% Looking at the economic conclusions taken, the reason why combustion motor cars are prevalent on the market is basically the overall price, with the other 3 options coming a bit behind moneywise. It would be interesting to maybe consider the Series/Parallel approach which has some good efficiency results but we didn’t get to study.
% Although the combustion powertrain is the cheapest one we should consider certain important aspects about the newer electric solution.
% The most prominent problem with electric cars is the buying price, with the battery price continuing to be really high and, in some cases, needing to be replaced after an accident. But this issue may change soon, with the development of electric cars technology as well as the virtuous cycle of ever-lower prices that leads to increasing demand and therefore the economies of scale manufacturers need to produce ever-cheaper batteries and cars.
% Second important aspect is climate friendly aspect which the combustion car lacks. This being an serious care for most countries around the world it is understandable the government efforts to help grow this market, which once again helps buying power of customers in an initial phase. In the middle we got the series and parallel powertrains that have lower gas emissions than the combustion but still are a problem for the environment.
